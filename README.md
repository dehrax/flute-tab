## Develop

Get started by running

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

It runs webpack and all the other good stuff.

## Build

`yarn build` creates a `bundle.js` and `index.html` in the root directory, ready to be served. The repo is currently deployed to Netlify, but the plan is to add a backend and run it on Heroku.

html-template is in the /public folder.
